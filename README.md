## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Responsive units: `rem`, `em`, `px`, `%`, `vh`, `vw`
- BEM methodology
- Media queries (mobile-first)
- CSS transitions and transform
- `@font-face` with local fonts

### What I Learned

This project taught me how to structure a layout using a mobile-first approach with clean scaling at larger breakpoints. I also improved my understanding of how `vw` and `%` behave in responsive containers, and how to manage consistent typography using `@font-face` and font weights. It also helped reinforce BEM naming for CSS maintainability.

### Continued Development

For future projects, I plan to focus on:

- CSS Grid for complex layouts
- Container queries
- Accessibility (ARIA, focus handling)
- Better CSS architecture (ITCSS, atomic CSS)
- Performance optimization (font loading, render performance)
- Modern CSS tools and techniques like `clamp()`
